// Holds the depth and alpha buffers to their ring arithmetic: how far the ring spans, where
// a point within it lands, how an address that walks off either end folds back, what a run
// fill writes, and which entries a pan and an update reset.
//
// Every expectation is written as an absolute byte offset from the buffer base and every

// carry addresses as integers or as pointers. That is deliberate: it is what lets the same
// expectations be checked before and after that representation changes.
